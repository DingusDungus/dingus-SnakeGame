# Snake The Game
#### Made by Dingus

<p>This snake game is made in C/C++ and holds a very OO design throughout the whole code. I'm not finished with it but decided it would be a great first commit. It doesn't require sudo as it doesn't install any executables into /bin, it's only a small game made by a very rookie developer.</p>

## Info
You install the game easily through `make clean all`. The compilation uses `lld` to link the files together so if you have issues compiling make sure `lld` is installed. You can easily install `lld` through `sudo apt install lld` if you're on a debian based system. This game uses `ncurses` to handle I/O which means you might have issues compiling without it. However I've had no issues compiling it without ncurses installed on my system so I'd recommend waiting with installing it until you are met with issues. If you then want to run the game you can do this by writing `./SnakeGame` while being in the same directory as the game-files.

## Lastly
I merely created this very small project to better my skills in OO programming and of course, C++. You have full rights to do whatever you want with it. If you find any bugs I'd appreciate if you contact me through **gabriel.ivars01@protonmail.com**<br><br>
Hope all is good in these trying times<br>
